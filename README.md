## OsrsStats
This is a desktop app created in python using Tkinter. Using different methods of webscraping and data transformations i created a python library that can extract different statistics from players in Oldschool Runescape.
When the library was complete, i could use the different methods to create an interface to make use of the functionallity more user friendly.
### Preview of how the app looks

The application has two main features; displaying the users levels and monitoring the users activity.
During this project i wanted to learn more about webscraping and finding efficient ways to gather information from different sources. I also wished to learn more about creating desktop applications using python. I also explored how to create my own libraries which allows to 
share functionallity across different projects and platforms.
